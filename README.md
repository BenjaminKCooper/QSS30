# QSS 30.07 Final Project Model Repository

Click [here](http://qss30final.surge.sh/) to see the website.

Special thanks to Seth for helping me to develop my ideas, and to Tim Tregubov for helping me with React Redux debugging!

On the website, use the slider to explore the history of Trump's tweets, and click the Dashboard/Graph button on top to switch views.

If anything is not working as expected, please let me know!


Interesting libraries I hope to use in extending this project further:
